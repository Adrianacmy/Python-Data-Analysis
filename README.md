# Data Analyzing with pydata-stack

## Description

This repo contains all jupyter notebooks while I am exploring interesting datasets. I gitignored all datasets since they are large files. 

## APPS

- [Thanksgiving dinner](./Analyzing-Thanksgiving-Dinnder/Basics.ipynb)
- [Exploring-Gun-Deaths-in-the-US](./Exploring-Gun-Deaths-in-the-US/Basics.ipynb)
- [Winning-Jeopardy](./Winning-Jeopardy/Basics.ipynb)

- [PDX-Transportation](./PDX-Transportation/Basics.ipynb)


## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Clone this repo
- Create env for this project `conda env create -f environment.yaml`(My yaml file contains too many dependencies due to long time accumunation, so I simply gitignored it. It is better to create yours and install them along the way.)
- Activate env: `source activate env_name`
- Launch Jupyter notebook
- View notebooks
